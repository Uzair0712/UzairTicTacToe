# UzairTicTacToe
This is one of the earlier projects when I was learning C language and Programming in general. 
<br>
<strong>The logic in the game was not taked from anywhere on the internet, I wanted to test myself and see if I can build things on my own or not. </strong>
<br>
There is a better logic available to build the game, but I am happy to keep the original logic that came to my mind, even thought it is very bulky and long.
